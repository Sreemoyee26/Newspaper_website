    <h2>Inspiration4 Sends “Ordinary People” to Space</h2>
    <div class="date">SEPTEMBER 16, 2021</div>
    <p>
        Last night, a group of four “ordinary” people blasted off into space in the first space mission with no professional astronauts. The four will remain in space, circling the Earth for three days before splashing down this weekend.
    </p>
    <p>The mission, called Inspiration4, was the idea of billionaire Jared Isaacman, who paid the company SpaceX to arrange the flight. Mr. Isaacman has long been interested in flying. He’s a pilot who has flown many different kinds of airplanes, including fighter jets.</p>
